## Story

## Gameplay
- There are two main situations for the player:
  - Shopping
    - While shopping, the player can talk to the current shopkeeper ? (is it a static menu where the player can only buy and leave or more like a merchant you can talk while top-down?) 
  - Fighting
    - While fighting, the player has to face multiple enemies that spawn randomly through the stage like thugs in an action movie.
    - The player can change its stance from shooting, to absorbing projectiles. While absorbing, he can be hit by specific projectiles to become more powerful and get points ? (decide how are we going to score), he cannot, however, fire anymore and becomes more vulnerable to enemy damage.
    - The fights happen in 3 arenas, representing the classical version of the movie, a remake and then a reboot. Before every fight, there's a meeting with a shopkeeper.
    - If the player finishes all 3 arenas without killing an enemy, he finishes the game.
